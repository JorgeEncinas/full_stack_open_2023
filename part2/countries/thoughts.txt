//HOW DO WE MODIFY STATE HERE.
//State logic must be kept within App, right?
//While we DO get the data here, maybe we're supposed to keep this function elsewhere.
//Somehow, we must BOTH return the country thing
//If currentCountry is an object, we can keep it within App.jsx
//And if countries.length === 0 then we know we can access it freely.
//Thus, it's possible.
