# FullStackOpen | 2023-2024

This repo shows my work for the FullStackOpen course.
I kind of already use React and Node at my current job.
Still, this course was what really helped cement the fundamentals I needeed,
and gave me a great jumpstart to get going.
As I haven't finished, and I really want to get into the more advanced parts,
I'll keep going!
